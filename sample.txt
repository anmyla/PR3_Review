In Java, StringReader is a class that extends Reader and is used for reading
character data from a String. It allows you to treat a String as a
character stream, making it useful when you need to read characters
from a String as if reading from a file or other input source.

With StringReader, you can read characters from a String using
methods such as read(), read(char[]), or read(char[], int, int).
It provides similar functionality to other Reader classes but operates
specifically on a String rather than a file or input stream.
This can be helpful in scenarios where you have character data stored
in a String and want to process it as a stream of characters.
